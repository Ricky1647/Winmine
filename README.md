Mine game
Mine game has the following rules:
1. There is a NxN grid.
2. Mine randomly selects M cells as the hidden mines.
3. Players do not know where are the hidden mines.
4. Then player starts to select a cell. If he is lucky, a number K will be printed on
that cell, where K is the number of mines surrounding the cell. Otherwise, if the cell has a mine then it will explode and game over.
5. Player can repeat the guessing process. Finally the mine game will give the player a " you win" or "you are dead" message and the game is over.
6.Expanding your Grid When you have not selected a bomb
